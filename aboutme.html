<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<P>Something we realized about the circuits is that the the long side of the Led wire has to be on the negative side. My favorite part of robot's dance is that we were able to succesfully make it go around as the song played. the idea was to show it dancing around and we were able to show that to the class. Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard would need sensorce that reconize other objects.
